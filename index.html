            <h2>Why You Should Care</h2>
            <p>AI in art is not just a technological advancement; it’s a cultural revolution. As AI continues to evolve, it’s reshaping how we think about creativity, originality, and the role of artists in society. This research delves into the implications of AI art, particularly *Edmond de Belamy*, and explores the critical questions it raises about the future of creativity and art markets.</p>

            <h2>The Research Problem: AI's Role in Art</h2>
            <p>As AI technologies like GANs increasingly influence creative fields, a critical question arises: how does AI challenge traditional notions of authorship, intentionality, and human agency in art creation? This research aims to address how AI acts as a tool that enhances rather than replaces human creativity. Understanding the philosophical and ethical implications of AI in art is crucial for rethinking the boundaries between human and machine creativity.</p>

            <h2>Sources and Methods</h2>
            <p>This research examines key works in AI-generated art, focusing on studies by Elgammal et al. (2017) and Mazzone and Elgammal (2019). These studies lay the groundwork for understanding how AI systems like GANs are used as tools in the creative process. The methodology combines analysis of AI art exhibitions, case studies, and philosophical exploration of concepts such as authorship and human-machine collaboration in the context of computational creativity.</p>

            <h2>Why This Research Matters</h2>
            <p>By exploring AI's impact on the creative process, this research contributes to the ongoing conversation about how AI can reshape the role of the artist. It offers new perspectives on how AI tools enhance rather than replace human creativity. If we fail to engage with these issues, we risk misunderstanding the evolving relationship between technology and art, which may lead to ethical and legal complications in the art world.</p>
